tex.warning						= Note: If you are using the "Use LaTeX for Labels" option, then you are responsible for all $ symbols in this LaTeX. The LaTeX displayed in this software is assisted so that errors due to the lack of $ symbols are suppressed.  This will cause errors in exported EPS and in the above code if you have failed to include necessary $ symbols.  If for example you created an edge label "\\sigma", you should have specified it as "$\\sigma$". If you are NOT using the "Use LaTeX for Labels" option, special symbols are automatically escaped for you.
